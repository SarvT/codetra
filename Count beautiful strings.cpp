Geek love strings having atmost one character whose frequency is odd and rest all (if exists) characters have even frequencies, he calls such strings as beautiful strings. Geek has a box containing n strings. You have to help him in counting number of pairs (i,j) (0<i<j<n-1) such that a string formed by concatenating string at index i with string at index j is a beautiful string. 

Note: Strings consist of only lowercase English letters.
